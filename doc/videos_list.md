Intuition behind applying machine learning and gradient descent methods:
-----------------------------
[Intuition video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR9h47Jtqyw)
* Pay attention to the gradient descent explanation, it's a recurring theme througout the presentation


Understanding how neural networks work:
-----------------------------
[Deep learning demistified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9Z20HCPnww)

[Deep nets explained well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILsA4nyG7I0)
* in-depth explanation of the mechanisms in a fully-connected neural net

[TedX: Deep learning in Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qVOUD76JOg)
* watch from 2:42 watch at faster speed (he's talking kind of slow)
* somewhat more high-level, but you'll get nice examples and intuition


Convolutional neural networks
-----------------------------
[Convolutional neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiN9p5vWHDY)
* very rough overview, just to get you up to speed

[Convnets explained well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmpDIaiMIeA)
* in-depth explanation of the mechanisms in a convolutional neural net

Use cases:
-----------------------------

* very rough overview

Examples of neural networks
-----------------------------
[DRAW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt-7MI9eKEo)
* a network that can learn how to draw hand-written digits itself
